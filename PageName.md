# Installation #

  * Download or build di-wrapper **dinput.dll**
  * Copy **dinput.dll** into the game directory, where was the main executable

# Trobleshooting #

  * If buttons didnt work, try reconfigure in game controll options
  * If nothing works, you can safely delete **dinput.dll**, this brings back old _DirectInput_ functioning, then contact me ;)
